        <p>This tool doesn't work without JavaScript. To be clear, it also doesn't track you, or mine bitcoin, or do anything nefarious. Don't believe me? <a href="https://github.com/jbritain/patchbin">Check for yourself.</a></p>
        <p>What it does do, though, is run all processing client-side. No data is ever sent to a server, because not only do I not want to pay the cost of hosting something like that, but I also think that there's no point in doing it that way if it's possible to do it on the client.</p>
        <br>
        <p>So, as much as it may pain you, if you want to use this tool, you will need to add this site to your JavaScript whitelist.</p>

    <p>a utility for generating binary patches that can be used to reconstruct a modified version of a file without directly distributing that modification</p>
    <hr>
    <p>if you are looking to generate a patch file to distribute, upload the original file and your modified version, and click "generate patch". you can then safely distribute the downloaded '.bin' file without violating any licensing agreements.</p>
    <p>if you have been given a patch file, upload the original file and the patch file, and click "apply patch".</p>
    <p>if you find this utility useful, consider <a href="https://ko-fi.com/jbritain">donating</a> to help me keep the lights on.</p>
